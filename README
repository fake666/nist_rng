NIST SP 800-90 CTR_DRBG

This code implements a random number generator based on
section 10.2 "DRBG Mechanisms Based on Block Ciphers" in
NIST SP 800-90.  More specifically, it implements CTR_DRBG
with a derivation function using AES-256 as the block
encryption function.

Security strength, prediction resistance, and the like apply
to a higher level interface than is currently implemented
(the algorithm as implemented can be used to support
prediction resistance a security strength of up to 256).

It gives the same output on i386/OpenBSD, amd64/FreeBSD and
Windows, but without test vectors one shouldn't say a whole
lot more about that output (diehard seems happy, but that
could be true even if things were severely screwed up).

TODO

The API should be based on the "envelope" described in
chapter 9 and section F.3.2.  So far, only the section 10.2
algorithm is implemented.

The code lacks both test vectors and a way to validate them.

Some basic runtime self-tests need to be implemented (and
enforced by the various API functions).

The code should be reviewed to make sure it is consistent
with SP 800-90 (there are comments throughout the code
referencing the relevant parts of SP 800-90).

The Makefile will likely need some tweaks for anything other
than OpenBSD or FreeBSD.
